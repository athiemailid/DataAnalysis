# Peak Hour Analysis with Waiting Time and Normal Distribution

This project aims to identify peak hours based on waiting time data extracted from a CSV file. It utilizes Python and the concept of normal distribution to analyze the waiting times and determine periods of high traffic or activity.

## Overview

The core functionality of this project involves:

1.  **Data Loading:** Reading waiting time data from a CSV file into a Python data structure.
2.  **Data Processing:** Cleaning and preparing the waiting time data for analysis.
3.  **Normal Distribution Analysis:**
    * Calculating the mean and standard deviation of the waiting times.
    * Using the normal distribution to identify outliers or periods of significantly higher waiting times.
    * Identifying time periods where waiting times exceed a certain threshold (e.g., above a certain number of standard deviations from the mean).
4.  **Peak Hour Identification:** Determining the time ranges that correspond to the identified periods of high waiting times, representing peak hours.
5.  **Basic Output:** displaying the identified peak hours.

## Basic Implementation Details

* **Python:** The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries like `csv` for data loading and `statistics` (or `numpy` for more advanced statistical calculations) for normal distribution analysis.
* **CSV Input:** The project expects waiting time data in a CSV file, with a column containing the waiting time values and a column containing the time of the waiting time.
* **Normal Distribution:** A basic normal distribution assumption is used to identify outliers. More advanced statistical methods can be implemented in future versions.
* **Output:** The script will output the identified peak hours based on the waiting time analysis.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x installed.
    * A CSV file containing waiting time data.
2.  **Installation:**
    * No external libraries are required for the basic version, if you use the statistics module. If you decide to use numpy, you will have to install it: `pip install numpy`
3.  **Usage:**
    * Place your CSV file in the same directory as the Python script.
    * Run the Python script.
    * The script will print the identified peak hours to the console.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement more sophisticated statistical methods for peak hour detection.
* Add support for different data formats.
* Visualize the waiting time data and peak hours using graphs.
* Allow users to configure parameters such as the threshold for peak hour detection.
* Add more robust error handling.
* Add the ability to save the results to a file.
